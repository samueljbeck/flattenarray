# Flatten Nested Array
Challenge:  Write some code to flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers (e.g., [[1,2,['foo']],4] -> [1,2,'foo',4].

So the biggest challenge on this project was the instruction mentioned "nested arrays of integers" but also included strings.

I included strings in the flattened array solution.

The code is in FlattenArray

The test is in FlattenArrayTest

In Android Studio open the project.  You will receive a Gradle Sync message.  Click OK.  It will take a few minutes to build.  To run the tests right click on canFlattenArray in FlattenArrayTest.
